# Solidity Fuzzing Benchmarks

This repository contains Solidity contracts and tests used to benchmark performance of fuzzers.
It's structured to primarily benchmark performance of the [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/) and [Dapptools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools) fuzzers.

Benchmarks in this repo have been pulled from:
- The [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) README
- [Targeted Greybox Fuzzing with Static Lookahead Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07147.pdf), by Valentin WÃ¼stholz and Maria Christakis (these are the benchmarks used by [Harvey](https://mariachris.github.io/Pubs/FSE-2020-Harvey.pdf))

**TODO add benchmarks**
